# Interchanging Horizontally Adjacent Elements in a Multi-Dimensional Array

In this article, we will explore how to interchange horizontally adjacent elements in a multi-dimensional array, using a specific example of a three-dimensional array with two layers, two rows, and five columns. Our task is to interchange adjacent elements in each row while maintaining the overall structure of the array.

### Example Initialization

Let’s consider the following three-dimensional array:

```
[
  [
    ["Gela", "opton", "Prospero", "lydia", "toaza"],
    ["Xena", "taro", "gamma", "debt", "qubit"]
  ],
  // layer 1
  [
    ["Alpha", "Bravo", "Charlie", "Delta", "Echo"],
    ["Foxtrot", "Golf", "Hotel", "India", "Juliet"]
  ]
]
```

The objective is to interchange adjacent elements. For instance:

- "Gela" is swapped with "opton"; 
- "Prospero" is swapped with "lydia"; 
- "toaza" remains in place since there is no adjacent element to swap with.

This process will be applied to every row in the array. Note that we can operate on individual rows without worrying about the overall shape of the array.

### Initial Algorithm Development

Starting with the first layer's first row of our array, we will focus on their columns. First, we will define an anonymous function to facilitate our operations.

To pair up the adjacent elements, we can utilize the `partition` function. This function will create pairs from the adjacent elements, allowing us to flip their positions.

```python
mask = [1, 0] * (len(array) // 2) + ([0] if len(array) % 2 else [])
```

Using this mask, we can pair up elements. Upon reversing these pairs, we will need to merge them back together.

Finally, we will apply this procedure to all subarrays of rank 1 within our multi-dimensional array.

### Example Code Implementation

We will define a function `E` to handle the operation we’ve just described:

```python
def E(array):
    # Apply partition-intended function across each subarray
    return [reversed(p) for p in partition(array)]
```

Now, we can apply our function and observe the results. This approach offers one way to address the problem, but it is not the only method.

### Alternative Approaches

1. **Indexing Method**:
   We can generate indices for the elements in such a way that allows us to reorder them effectively.

2. **Using Stencil Operators**:
   Stencil operators work well with adjacent pairs and can automate the processing of the adjacent elements.

The following code shows how each approach can be implemented, starting again with the basic vector case and expanding to rank one multi-dimensional arrays.

### Performance Comparison

Testing various methods for performance on a larger dataset reveals interesting insights:

- **E** Function: Uses partition to create pairs.
- **I** Function: Reorders via direct indexing.
- **S** Function: Employs a stencil operator.

We can compare the execution times of these methods to see which performs better on larger multi-dimensional arrays.

### Optimizing the Approach

After profiling, we find that using simple indexing methods can yield substantial performance improvements. Instead of iterating through rows, we may redefine our methodology to treat the entire array as a single block.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the ability to interchange elements in a multi-dimensional array can be achieved with various techniques, and understanding the performance implications of each approach is crucial. By focusing on how we structure our operations, we can achieve not only correct results but also significant performance gains.

For those interested, we encourage trying out the implemented methods on larger datasets and exploring the differences in execution times. Thank you for following along!
