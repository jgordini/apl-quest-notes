## Getting Started

To begin solving these problems, simply click on the problem title or use the navigation menu on the left. Each problem page includes:

- A detailed problem statement
- Input and output examples
- Any necessary background information
- Hints to guide you towards a solution

Remember, the goal is not just to solve the problems, but to do so in the most APL-like way possible. Think in terms of arrays, leverage APL's powerful primitives, and strive for concise, elegant solutions.

## Tips for Success

- Read each problem statement carefully
- Start with the simpler problems to build momentum
- Don't hesitate to revisit APL's documentation for inspiration
- Remember that there are often multiple ways to solve a problem in APL
- Have fun and learn from each challenge!

Good luck, and may your arrays be ever in your favor!
