# Fitting Elements into a Square Array

In this article, we explore how to fit a list of elements into a square array, even when the number of elements may not perfectly match a square number. When the number of elements does not fill the array completely, we will need to implement padding.

## Example Scenario

Let's start with a simple example using the numbers `1, 2, 3, 4,` and `5`. 

- These numbers can fit into a `3x3` matrix, which would look like this:
```
1 2 3
4 5 0
0 0 0
```
- Notice here that we pad with zeros. 

However, these numbers cannot fit into a `2x2` square, as that would leave the `5` out.

## Finding the Appropriate Size

To determine the suitable size for our square, we need to base our logic on the number of elements. We can utilize a function to facilitate this. 

Using a lambda function, we introduce the variable `Ω`, which represents the count of elements. In our example, we have `5` elements:

```apl
{≢⍵} 1 2 3 4 5
```
This results in:
```
5
```

We need to find the nearest square number that can accommodate these elements. 

To achieve this, we calculate the square root of the count of elements:

```apl
{(≢⍵) * ÷ 2} 1 2 3 4 5
```
This results in:
```
2.236067977
```

Since `√5` is not a whole number, we must round it up to ensure the square is sufficiently large. The next integer is `3`. Therefore, we can define `s` to represent this value, which squared gives us:

```apl
{⌈(≢⍵) * ÷ 2} 1 2 3 4 5
```
This results in:
```
3
```

We derive the square number of elements which, in our case, is:

```apl
{s × s ← ⌈(≢⍵) * ÷ 2} 1 2 3 4 5
```
This yields:
```
9
```

This implies the final array will need `9` elements.

## Padding the Array

To pad the original list to fit the new size, we can utilize the `take` function. However, the `take` function requires us to provide the number of elements first, followed by the data. Consequently, we must swap the order of arguments. 

We can get the padded array using:

```apl
{⍵ ↑ ⍨ s × s ← ⌈(≢⍵) * ÷ 2} 1 2 3 4 5
```
This results in:
```
1 2 3 4 5 0 0 0 0
```

Now we have `9` elements, and the next step is to reshape the final array into `s` rows and `s` columns.

## Refining the Definition

We can refine our function slightly. We visualize the whole expression in terms of `s`, the outcome from the previous expression on the right. 

By utilizing a tested function, we can perform self-multiplication:

```apl
{s * s} 1 2 3 4 5
```
This gives:
```
9
```

This means we need to pad our original argument from the outside, ultimately reshaping the array to align with our specifications.

### Self-Concatenation

Instead of using `s` explicitly, we can explore another approach. By replacing the explicit naming of `s` with a functional notation, we can express the operation more concisely.

Using a function that applies the same argument on both sides:

```apl
{(,⍨⍴ × ⍨ ↑⍵⍨) ⌈ (≢⍵) * ÷ 2} 1 2 3 4 5
```

This notation offers a neat and compact way to implement our logic without cluttering it with variable declarations.

## Conclusion

This concise method is an effective way to arrange elements into a square array while managing padding gracefully. Thank you for following along in this exploration of square array fitting.
