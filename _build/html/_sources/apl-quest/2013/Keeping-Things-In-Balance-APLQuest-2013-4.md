# Maintaining Balanced Parentheses in APL

Hello and welcome to this fourth APL quest! Today's quest is called **Keeping Things in Balance**. In this session, we will take a character vector that contains parentheses and check whether the parentheses are balanced. A balanced set of parentheses is where each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis and vice versa. We will also look for cases where there are closing parentheses that aren't paired with opening ones or opening parentheses that are left unclosed.

## Getting Started

Let's start by creating some test data to see how this works. We will create a character vector with a balanced expression, for example:

```apl
t ← '(1 2)×(3+(3÷4))×(1+2)÷8'
```

The approach we will take today is to determine where the depth of the parentheses nesting changes. There are several ways to do this, but we will begin with a simple and classic approach from APL.

### Normalizing Input

First, we will convert the input into a normalized form where we can look up every character in this test case. The indices of its characters will be represented in terms of opening parentheses, closing parentheses, or any other character.

This means:
- `1` for an opening parenthesis `(`
- `2` for a closing parenthesis `)`
- `3` for any other character

Now, we need to map these indices to indicate when the parenthesis level changes. We can do this by creating a vector where:
- Opening parentheses increase the level,
- Closing parentheses decrease the level,
- Any other character does not affect the level.

### Implementing the Function

We can now create a function that will index into the input vector and track the changes in parenthesis depth, which we'll call `parenthesis_depth_changes`, using indexing techniques:

```apl
Di ← {1 ¯1 0['()'⍳⍵]}  ⍝ Depth changes function based on character
```

Next, we can use variations of this function to enhance its capabilities:

```apl
Df ← '('∘= - =∘')' ⍝ Tacit function to calculate depth changes 
```

### Performance Comparisons

Having set up the basic structure, we will now generate larger test data to compare performance across different methods for evaluating the depth of parentheses. For instance, we can obtain source code snippets from `Turtle` and `Joy` programming languages, which we know have balanced and unbalanced parentheses respectively. Reshaping these snippets will allow us to conduct thorough tests.

By creating expressions programmatically, we can easily evaluate the performance of each implementation using `cmpx`, assessing which variations are fastest under different conditions:

```apl
(y n) ← (⊢⍴⍨100×⍴)⍤⎕VR¨'turtle' 'joy'
```

### Determining Balanced Parentheses

Having established the methods for tracking depth changes, our ultimate goal is to determine if the entire character vector's parentheses are balanced. 

To define balanced parentheses, we need to fulfill two conditions:
1. At the end of evaluation, the parenthesis level must return to zero,
2. Throughout the evaluation, the parenthesis level must never go below zero.

We can implement this check with the following APL expressions:

```apl
Ba ← (∧/0≤+\)∧0=+/  ⍝ Condition for balanced parentheses
Bn ← (¯1∊+\)⍱0≠+/  ⍝ Condition checking for depth levels
```

Combining these checks will yield a robust function to determine if a character vector's parentheses are balanced.

### Alternative Solutions

While we've discussed performance-focused solutions, other interesting methodologies can include using [regular expressions](https://xpqz.github.io/cultivations/Regex.html) to validate balanced parentheses. Although not optimal for APL, using regular expressions can offer insights from programming experiences in languages like Perl.

Utilizing Quad R, a modern APL feature, allows character replacements without the overhead of regex. This opens up alternatives but remains less efficient compared to pure APL solutions we've developed. Here are the relevant APL expressions to handle replacements:

```apl
Re  ← ''≡'\(\)'⎕R''⍣≡⍤∩∘'()'  ⍝ Regex replacement until no parentheses left
Re0 ← ''≡'()'⎕R''⍠'Regex'0⍣≡⍤∩∘'()'  ⍝ Plain text without escaping
Fi  ← ''≡(⊢(/⍨)¯1(⊢⍱⌽)'()'∘⍷)⍣≡⍤∩∘'()'  ⍝ Using find function
```

### Creative Solutions

Finally, we explored humorous yet unconventional solutions that leverage APL’s built-in parenthesis handling during expression evaluation. By creating expressions deliberately with mismatched parentheses, we can invoke APL's error-reporting to check for balance:

```apl
Nd ← {0::0 ⋄ (⍎'{} '['()'⍳⍵])/1}  ⍝ Error guard to check parentheses balance
Np ← {0::0 ⋄ ⊃∊⍎⍕1,1,¨⍵∩'()'}  ⍝ Format and execute for balance check
```

### Conclusion

Through an exploration of various methodologies for maintaining balanced parentheses in APL—from logic-based depth checks to utilizing regex and APL's exceptional parsing capabilities—we've gained insight into both performance considerations and the power of APL to elegantly manage such problems.

Thank you for joining this quest to understand how to keep things balanced!
