# Constructing Concentric Rings of Numbers

In this article, we will explore a method for constructing concentric rings of numbers, where a given number is placed at the center, and we decrease the numbers as we create rings around it until we reach one.

## Concept Overview

Let's say our argument is `5`. In our construction, we will place `5` in the middle, followed by `4`, then `3`, and so on down to `1`. The result will resemble a large concentric arrangement:

```
4 4 4 4 4
4 3 3 3 4
4 3 5 3 4
4 3 3 3 4
4 4 4 4 4
```

To create this structure, we can define a monadic function in APL that takes an integer scalar as an argument. Here’s an example of how we define such a function:

```apl
F ← { ⍴(∘.⊢⌊⍨⍳(0⌈¯1+2×⍵)) }
```

## Generating the Sequence

To create this concentric ring structure, we first need to generate the sequence of numbers:

1. Start with the center number as the argument (e.g., `5`).
2. Create rings around it, decreasing the values as we move outward (i.e., `4`, `3`, `2`, `1`).
3. Form the sequence and then reverse it to create the outer layers.

In APL, we can generate a sequence using:

```apl
⍳5
```

This will yield the sequence:

```
1 2 3 4 5
```

As we reverse the sequence, we must ensure that we avoid duplicating the middle element. This can be accomplished by dropping the first element of the reversed sequence using:

```apl
(⊢,1↓⌽) ⍳5
```

This output will be:

```
1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1
```

## Expanding to a Matrix

Next, we need to expand this sequence into a full matrix format. One way to visualize it is to think of it as a multiplication table. For example, we can create an outer product of our sequence:

```apl
(⊢,1↓⌽) ⍳5
```

This will create:

```
1 2 3 4 5 5 4 3 2 1
```

However, we don't need a traditional multiplication table. Instead, to visualize the minimum values from the respective rows and columns, we can apply the following function:

```apl
(∘.×⍨⊢,1↓⌽) ⍳5
```

This gives us:

```
1  2  3  4  5  4  3  2 1
2  4  6  8 10  8  6  4 2
3  6  9 12 15 12  9  6 3
4  8 12 16 20 16 12  8 4
5 10 15 20 25 20 15 10 5
4  8 12 16 20 16 12  8 4
3  6  9 12 15 12  9  6 3
2  4  6  8 10  8  6  4 2
1  2  3  4  5  4  3  2 1
```

Now, applying a final minimum function leads us to the correct concentric rings structure. Using APL:

```apl
(∘.⌊⍨⊢,1↓⌽) ⍳5
```

Results in:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1
1 2 3 3 3 3 3 2 1
1 2 3 4 4 4 3 2 1
1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1
1 2 3 4 4 4 3 2 1
1 2 3 3 3 3 3 2 1
1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

## Minimum Function

To achieve the desired form, we implement a minimum function. The minimum function is represented in APL as follows:

```apl
F ←{∘.⌊⍨⊢,1↓⌽}  ⍳
```

By applying this minimum function across our rows and columns, we ensure that the final output reflects the correct rings.

## Final Implementation

This process can be encapsulated in a function `F`, where we can apply `F` to our sequence. This will yield the concentric ring pattern we desire:

```apl
F 5
```

This returns the successful construction of concentric rings:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1
1 2 3 3 3 3 3 2 1
1 2 3 4 4 4 3 2 1
1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1
1 2 3 4 4 4 3 2 1
1 2 3 3 3 3 3 2 1
1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
