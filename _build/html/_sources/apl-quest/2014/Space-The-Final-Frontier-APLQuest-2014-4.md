# APL Quest: Normalizing Text Spaces

Welcome to the APL Quest! For more details, you can visit the APL Wiki. Today's quest is the fourth from the 2014 edition of the APL problem-solving competition. 

The objective is to normalize text by eliminating unwanted spaces, specifically:

- **Leading spaces**: Spaces at the beginning of the text.
- **Trailing spaces**: Spaces at the end of the text.
- **Excessive internal spaces**: More than one space between words should be reduced to a single space.

### Problem Overview

Given a character vector, we want to:

1. Remove any leading spaces.
2. Remove any trailing spaces.
3. Condense multiple spaces between words into a single space.

### Methodology

1. **Identifying Non-Spaces**: 
   - First, we identify non-space characters within the text to understand where we have spaces that need to be evaluated.

   ```apl
   A ← { (' '=⊃⍵) ↓ ⍵ / ⍨ 2 ∨ / 0, ⍨ ' ' ≠ ⍵ }
   ```

2. **Handling Trailing Spaces**: 
   - We check if the last character is a space and may need to remove it conditionally. 

   ```apl
   B ← ' ' ∘ (= ∘ ⊃ ↓ ⊢ ⊢ ⍤ / ⍨ 2 ∨ / 0, ⍨ ≠)
   ```

3. **Compacting Internal Spaces**: 
   - We compact excessive spaces by filtering adjacent spaces using various methods:

   ```apl
   C ← ' ' ∘ (1↓,⊢ ⍤ / ⍨ 1(⊢∨⌽) 0, ≠)
   D ← ' ' ∘ (= ∘ ⊃ ↓ ⊢ ⊢ ⍤ / ⍨ 1↓1(⊢∨⌽) 0, ≠)  ⍝ conditionally remove instead of
   ```

4. **Generalization**: 
   - We can generalize the solution to accept any character, not just spaces, allowing for broader applications of this functionality.

   ```apl
   G ← { ⍵ / ⍨ ¯1 ↓ (∨\∧⊢∨1⌽⊢) 0, ⍨ ' ' ≠ ⍵ }
   ```

5. **Testing Scenarios**: 
   - Generate various test cases to ensure all combinations of leading, internal, and trailing spaces are handled correctly.
   
   ```apl
   testCases ← {
       # Leading Spaces
       '   Hello World',
       # Trailing Spaces
       'Hello World   ',
       # Multiple Internal Spaces
       'Hello    World!',
       # Combination
       '   Hello   World   '
   }
   ```

### Implementation Steps

1. **Finding Non-Spaces**:
    - Use a vector to track where characters are located, ensuring we capture the spaces at the end. 

2. **Compact Spaces**:
   - Perform adjacent space reduction to compress spaces into one.

3. **Trimming Spaces**:
   - Finally, check if the input starts or ends with spaces and remove them conditionally.

### Implementation in APL

Let's dive into how the functionality is implemented in APL. We can create a function, let's say `normalize`, that encapsulates our steps:

```apl
normalize ← { 
    text ← ⍵
    # Step 1: Remove leading spaces
    trimmed ← (text ≠ ' ') / text 
    # Step 2: Remove trailing spaces
    trimmed ← trimmed / (⍨ (≠) ' ')
    # Step 3: Compact multiple spaces to a single space 
    compressed ← (1≠/ ⍨ trimmed) 
    # Step 4: Return the final normalized text
    compressed
}
```

### Performance Comparison

After implementing the function, we can compare the performance of different strategies (adjacent reduction vs. cyclic rotation vs. regex solutions) to see which executes faster.

```apl
# Comparing different methods
performanceTest ← {
    testCase ← ⍵
    aResult ← methodA testCase
    bResult ← methodB testCase
    ...
    # Analyze timing here
}
```

### Summary

In summary, the overall approach to text normalization in APL combines clever usage of boolean vectors, adjacent space handling, and functional composition. 

By exploring the following different methods for implementation:
- Using basic character comparisons
- Regex operations
- Splitting and joining techniques

We ensure both robustness and performance:

```apl
# Performance Comparison
cmpx 'A¨t' 'B¨t'
cmpx ('C'iotag'I'),¨⊂'¨t'
cmpx'J¨t' 'K¨t' 'L¨t'
cmpx('M'iotag'P'),¨⊂'¨t'
cmpx'Q¨t' 'R¨t' 'S¨t'
```

Thank you so much for participating in the APL Quest!
