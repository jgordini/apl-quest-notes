# Welcome to APL Quest

APL Quest is an annual programming challenge that focuses on Array Programming Language (APL). Since its inception in 2013, APL Quest has been offering a series of engaging and thought-provoking problems that challenge participants to think in terms of arrays and leverage the power of APL.

## What is APL?

APL (A Programming Language) is a high-level, array-oriented programming language developed by Kenneth E. Iverson in the 1960s. It's known for its concise syntax and powerful array operations, making it particularly well-suited for mathematical and statistical computations.

## About APL Quest

APL Quest presents a set of 10 problems each year, designed to:

1. Test your problem-solving skills
2. Encourage creative thinking in terms of array operations
3. Showcase the expressive power and conciseness of APL
4. Challenge both beginners and experienced APL programmers

The problems range from simple array manipulations to complex algorithmic challenges, all solvable with APL's unique approach to computation.

## Structure of This Book

This Jupyter Book is organized by year, from 2013 to 2023. Each year contains:

- An index page introducing that year's challenges
- Individual pages for each of the 10 problems

You can navigate through the problems chronologically or jump to specific years or problems that interest you.

## Getting Started

If you're new to APL, don't worry! Each problem comes with:

- A clear problem statement
- Input and output examples
- Hints and tips to guide you

Even if you're not familiar with APL, these problems can be a great way to start thinking in terms of array operations.

## Join the Quest!

Whether you're an APL expert or a curious beginner, APL Quest offers a unique opportunity to sharpen your skills, learn new techniques, and experience the joy of solving problems in one of the most fascinating programming languages ever created.
