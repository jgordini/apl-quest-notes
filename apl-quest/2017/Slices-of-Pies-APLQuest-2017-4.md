# Computing Areas of Circle Sectors Using APL

In this article, we will compute the areas of circle sectors using APL as the mathematical notation. By reasoning about and simplifying the mathematical formula, we will find an efficient way to express these computations.

## Understanding the Area of a Circle

One way to visualize the area of a circle is to think of it as being "unrolled" into its infinitely thin slices (or sectors). When placed side by side, they form a rectangle. The long sides of this rectangle are provided by the circumference of the circle, while the short side corresponds to the radius.

To recall some basic formulas:

- The **radius** of a circle can be computed from the **diameter**:
  
  \[$\text{radius} = \frac{\text{diameter}}{2}$]
  
  In APL, this is represented as:
  
  ```apl
  R ← Ω ÷ 2
  ```
  
- The **circumference** of a circle is given by:
  \[$\text{circumference} = \pi \times \text{diameter}$\]

Knowing that there are two long sides formed by the circumference, the area \(A\) of the circle can be computed as:

\[$A = \text{short side} \times \text{long side} = r \times \left( \frac{\pi \times \text{diameter}}{2} \right)$\]

Substituting for \(r\) gives:

\[$A = \pi \times r^2$\]

## APL Representation

In APL, we can express this calculation quite easily. Although APL does not directly represent \(\pi\), it uses a circle function (\(○\)) for multiplication by \(\pi\).

To calculate the area of a circle, we establish:

```apl
Circle R = ○ R
```

Thus, the area becomes:
```apl
Area ← Circle R × R
```

### Testing with Values

Let's apply this to calculate the areas of circles with diameters 9, 12, and 15. APL automatically maps arithmetic operations, so we calculate the results as follows:

```apl
Area ← ○ (9 12 15 ÷ 2) × (9 12 15 ÷ 2)
```

This will provide the corresponding areas for each diameter.

## Computing Area of Circle Sectors

Now, if we want to compute the area of a sector of a circle, we must define what fraction of the full circle we are interested in. For example, for a 60-degree sector, we determine:

\[$\text{fraction} = \frac{60}{360} = \frac{1}{6}$\]

The area of this sector becomes:

```apl
SectorArea ← (Alpha ÷ 360) × Area
```

Where \(Alpha\) is the angle in degrees.

### Simplifying the Calculation

To simplify our approach, we might want to perform some algebraic manipulations. Here's one way to consolidate our expressions by noting that the area can also be represented using \(\Omega\):

Instead of \(\Omega\) divided by 2, consider:

\[
$\text{Area} = \frac{\Omega^2}{4} \frac{60}{360} = \frac{\Omega^2}{24}$
\]

This is equivalent to multiplying by \(1440\):

```apl
Area = Ω^2 ÷ 1440
```

### Using Tacit Functions

In APL, we can also use tacit functions, which allow us to define operations without explicitly mentioning the arguments. We can create an efficient tacit expression for the area of the sector:

```apl
SectorArea ← ○ (α × Ω) ÷ 360
```

This leverages the tacit style to express the area calculation yet succinctly.

### Conclusion

By adequately leveraging APL's constructs, we can achieve an efficient formulation for calculating areas of both circles and their sectors. Our final APL expression might look something like this:

```apl
SectorArea ← (α × ○ Ω) ÷ 360
```

This summarizes the necessary computations neatly.
